## Fix: Clipboard copy not working on Windows

### Problem
In `app/overlay.py`, the `_copy_to_clipboard` method writes to clipboard but data doesn't persist on Windows. PyQt6 clipboard.setText() returns but clipboard.text() shows 0 length immediately after.

Debug output showed:
```
[COPY] _response_text length: 1462
[COPY] Final text length: 1462
[COPY] Wrote to clipboard, verify: 0
```

### Solution
Use pyperclip as a reliable cross-platform clipboard solution instead of Qt's clipboard.

1. Add `import pyperclip` at top of `app/overlay.py`
2. Replace the `_copy_to_clipboard` method with:

```python
def _copy_to_clipboard(self) -> None:
    """Copy response text to system clipboard."""
    text = self._response_text or self._text_edit.toPlainText()
    if text:
        try:
            import pyperclip
            pyperclip.copy(text)
        except Exception:
            # Fallback to Qt clipboard
            clipboard = QApplication.clipboard()
            clipboard.setText(text)
            QApplication.processEvents()
```

3. Add pyperclip to requirements.txt if not already present

### Validation
Run the app, get a response in overlay, click copy button [C], paste in notepad - should work.
