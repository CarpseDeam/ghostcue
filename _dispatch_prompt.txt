Fix two bugs in widget-helper:

## Bug 1: OCR coroutine never awaited (app/ocr.py)

The error:
```
C:\Projects\widget-helper\app\ocr.py:58: RuntimeWarning: coroutine 'WindowsOCR._extract_async' was never awaited
  return OCRResult(text="", success=False, error=str(e))
```

Current code in `extract_text()`:
```python
try:
    loop = asyncio.new_event_loop()
    asyncio.set_event_loop(loop)
    result = loop.run_until_complete(self._extract_async(path))
    loop.close()
    return result
except Exception as e:
    return OCRResult(text="", success=False, error=str(e))
```

Problem: If exception occurs after coroutine is created but before/during run_until_complete, the coroutine object leaks. Also the loop.close() isn't in a finally block.

Fix: Use try/finally to ensure loop cleanup, and handle the coroutine properly.

## Bug 2: numpy fromstring deprecation in soundcard (app/loopback_worker.py)

The error:
```
[DEBUG] Subprocess error: Capture error: The binary mode of fromstring is removed, use frombuffer instead
```

This comes from the `soundcard` library (mediafoundation.py) which uses deprecated `np.fromstring()` that was removed in numpy 2.x.

Fix: Add a monkey-patch at the TOP of loopback_worker.py (before soundcard import) to shim `np.fromstring` to use `np.frombuffer`:

```python
import numpy as np
# Monkey-patch for soundcard compatibility with numpy 2.x
if not hasattr(np, 'fromstring') or np.__version__.startswith('2'):
    np.fromstring = lambda s, dtype=None, count=-1, sep='': np.frombuffer(s if isinstance(s, bytes) else s.encode(), dtype=dtype, count=count)
```

This must be BEFORE `import soundcard as sc`.

Make both fixes. Keep the code clean and minimal.

## Code Standards

Write code that looks inevitable. Follow these constraints:

**Restraint**
- Solve it in one file if possible
- No abstractions until the third time you need them
- No classes if functions will do
- No inheritance - use composition

**Functions**
- Max 25 lines, aim for 15
- One level of nesting max
- Name describes exactly what it does: `extract_billable_hours()` not `process_data()`
- Input → transform → output. No side effects unless that's the point.

**Files**
- Max 200 lines for new files
- One clear responsibility
- If you're adding a second "system" to a file, stop and split

**No Ceremony**
- No AbstractFactory, no IServiceProvider, no Manager classes
- No code "just in case" - solve the actual problem
- Delete commented-out code, don't keep it

**Data**
- Use dataclasses or plain dicts, not classes with only __init__ and getters
- Data flows obviously - reader should predict what happens next
- No global state

The best code is code you delete. Every line is a liability.
