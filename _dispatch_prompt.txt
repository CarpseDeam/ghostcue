# Phase 1: Test Generation

## CRITICAL: TRUST THE SPEC

The specification below is COMPLETE. Do not:
- Read README, ARCHITECTURE, or documentation files
- Search for patterns or conventions in the codebase
- Explore directory structures
- Read files unrelated to test generation

Only read files that:
1. You need to import from (check the target path's neighbors)
2. Contain types/classes referenced in the interface

The spec tells you exactly what to test. Trust it.

## CIRCUIT BREAKER

If you have made 8+ file reads without writing any code, STOP.
You are exploring instead of implementing. The spec is complete.
Write the tests now with what you know.

## CRITICAL CONSTRAINT: DO NOT WRITE IMPLEMENTATION CODE

You are FORBIDDEN from writing implementation code in this phase.
Your ONLY task is to generate the test file.
Do not create the implementation file.
Do not write any production code.
Only write tests.

## THE SPECIFICATION

# Specification: ErrorRecoveryAndAsyncClaude
Tier: HOTFIX

## Description
Improve reliability and latency for widget-helper interview tool.

## Must Do
- Add `self._reconnect_loopback_signals()` call in `_on_streaming_error`
- Convert ClaudeProvider to use AsyncAnthropic
- Preserve all existing signal emissions (text_chunk, response_complete, error_occurred)
- Keep type hints and docstrings

## Must Not Do
- Change any other files
- Modify GeminiProvider
- Change the BaseProvider interface
- Add new dependencies (anthropic already supports async)

## Edge Cases
- API key missing → still emit error_occurred signal
- Mid-stream failure → emit error_occurred, return empty string
- Empty response → still emit response_complete

## Validation
- Tests: pytest tests/ -v

## YOUR TASK

Create a pytest test suite at: `tests/test_errorrecoveryandasyncclaude.py`

Test Generation Rules:
1. Create one test per 'Must Do' requirement
2. Create one test per edge case
3. Create tests for precondition violations
4. Create tests for postcondition verification
5. Create tests verifying 'Must Not Do' constraints

Write tests that will FAIL until implementation exists.
Do NOT write any implementation code.

Write clean, scalable, modular, efficient code. Follow single responsibility principle. Do not repeat yourself. Use consistent naming conventions. No unnecessary comments.
