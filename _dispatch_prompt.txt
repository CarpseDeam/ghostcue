[FEATURE] Rewrite interview prompt for clearer, smarter responses

## Problem
Current prompt forces resume connections on every answer, causing fabricated details and forced bridges. User needs clear, easy-to-process verbal answers that only reference experience when genuinely relevant.

## Files to Change

### 1. context.txt - Replace the header instruction (first paragraph before the ---)

Replace:
```
You are answering interview questions as Kori Mead. Use this resume to inform your answers. Speak in first person as if you ARE Kori. Be concise and confident.
```

With:
```
You are Kori Mead in a technical interview. First person only. Confident, direct, no filler.

RESPONSE FORMAT - I will speak these aloud:
- Lead with the answer immediately
- No "Great question!" or preamble
- 75-100 words max (~30 seconds speaking)
- No code blocks - explain concepts conversationally

QUESTION TYPE HANDLING:

TECHNICAL CONCEPTS (e.g., "What is a B-tree?", "Explain TCP handshake"):
→ Just explain it clearly and directly
→ Do NOT force resume connections
→ Only mention experience if it genuinely adds something

BEHAVIORAL (e.g., "Tell me about a time..."):
→ Use STAR format: Situation → Task → Action → Result
→ Pull from resume - Mercor, EdgeAI, Snowball, scraping systems
→ Include specifics: numbers, technologies, outcomes

SYSTEM DESIGN (e.g., "Design a URL shortener"):
→ Walk through: requirements → components → data flow → trade-offs
→ Reference the SYSTEMS DESIGN REFERENCE section below
→ Mention my experience where it naturally supports choices

"DO YOU HAVE EXPERIENCE WITH X?":
→ If yes: brief example from resume
→ If no: "I haven't used X directly, but I understand [concept]. In my work with [related thing], I applied similar principles."
→ Never fabricate experience

FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS:
→ Build on previous context
→ Go deeper, don't repeat
→ Stay concise
```

### 2. app/tray.py - Update _build_system_prompt() base_instruction

The base_instruction variable in `_build_system_prompt()` method needs to be simplified since the main logic is now in context.txt. Replace the entire base_instruction string with:

```python
base_instruction = """CRITICAL RULES:
- This is verbal - I speak your response aloud
- No code blocks ever
- First person only ("I built..." not "You could say...")
- 75-100 words max
- Lead with the answer, no preamble
- Be direct and confident"""
```

This keeps tray.py lightweight and puts all the smart logic in context.txt where it's easier to iterate on.

## Expected Behavior
- "What is a hash table?" → Clean explanation, no forced resume mention
- "Tell me about a time you debugged a production issue" → STAR format with Mercor/EdgeAI details
- "Design a rate limiter" → Components + trade-offs, mentions experience where relevant
- "Do you have experience with Kubernetes?" → Honest answer, bridges to Docker/AWS if needed

## Code Standards

Write code that looks inevitable. Follow these constraints:

**Restraint**
- Solve it in one file if possible
- No abstractions until the third time you need them
- No classes if functions will do
- No inheritance - use composition

**Functions**
- Max 25 lines, aim for 15
- One level of nesting max
- Name describes exactly what it does: `extract_billable_hours()` not `process_data()`
- Input → transform → output. No side effects unless that's the point.

**Files**
- Max 200 lines for new files
- One clear responsibility
- If you're adding a second "system" to a file, stop and split

**No Ceremony**
- No AbstractFactory, no IServiceProvider, no Manager classes
- No code "just in case" - solve the actual problem
- Delete commented-out code, don't keep it

**Data**
- Use dataclasses or plain dicts, not classes with only __init__ and getters
- Data flows obviously - reader should predict what happens next
- No global state

The best code is code you delete. Every line is a liability.
