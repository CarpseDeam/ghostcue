# Phase 2: Implementation

## CRITICAL: TRUST THE SPEC

The specification below is COMPLETE. Do not:
- Read README, ARCHITECTURE, or documentation files
- Search for patterns or conventions in the codebase
- Explore directory structures
- Read files unrelated to your implementation

Only read files that:
1. You need to import from (check the target path's neighbors)
2. Contain types/classes referenced in the interface
3. The test file at the specified path

The spec tells you exactly what to build. Trust it.

## CIRCUIT BREAKER

If you have made 8+ file reads without writing any code, STOP.
You are exploring instead of implementing. The spec is complete.
Write the implementation now with what you know.

## CRITICAL CONSTRAINT: DO NOT MODIFY TESTS

You are FORBIDDEN from modifying the test file.
The tests at the path below are fixed and immutable.
Your task is to make them pass, not to change them.
Do not edit, delete, or modify any test code.

## TEST FILE LOCATION: `tests/test_interviewrecoveryfeatures.py`

Read this file to understand what you must implement.
Then implement the code to make all tests pass.

## THE SPECIFICATION

# Specification: InterviewRecoveryFeatures
Tier: FEATURE

## Description
Add three recovery features for live interview reliability.

## Interface
- `StealthOverlay.show_transcript(text: str) -> None` — Display heard text above response
- `TrayApp._on_retry_hotkey() -> None` — Re-send last transcript
- `TrayApp._on_cancel_response() -> None` — Cancel current streaming

## Must Do
- Store last transcript for retry functionality
- Show transcript label above response in overlay
- Track streaming task for cancellation
- Wire up F10 and Escape hotkeys via pynput
- Keep transcript visible during response streaming
- Show "Cancelled - press F10 to retry" message on cancel

## Must Not Do
- Change provider implementations
- Modify SessionManager
- Change the audio capture flow
- Add new dependencies

## Edge Cases
- F10 with no previous transcript → ignore silently
- F10 while already responding → ignore silently
- Escape when not responding → ignore silently
- Cancel then retry → should work (signals reconnected)

## Validation
- Tests: pytest tests/ -v

## YOUR TASK

Implement the specification at: `src/interviewrecoveryfeatures.py`

Implementation Rules:
1. Follow interface signatures EXACTLY
2. Implement minimal code to pass all tests
3. Handle all edge cases as specified
4. Ensure preconditions are checked
5. Ensure postconditions are satisfied

Run the tests and iterate until all pass.
Test command: pytest tests/ -v

Write clean, scalable, modular, efficient code. Follow single responsibility principle. Do not repeat yourself. Use consistent naming conventions. No unnecessary comments.
