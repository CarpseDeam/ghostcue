## Task: Fix Copy Button Debug + Unify S/A Button Prompts

### Context
The copy button in the overlay may not be firing, and the S/A buttons use different prompts than the audio flow (which has rich formatting instructions). We need to:
1. Add debug logging to copy functionality
2. Inject formatting rules into S/A button instructions

### File 1: app/overlay.py

**Location:** `_copy_to_clipboard()` method (around line 211-215)

**Current code:**
```python
def _copy_to_clipboard(self) -> None:
    text = self._response_text or self._text_edit.toPlainText()
    if text:
        clipboard = QApplication.clipboard()
        clipboard.setText(text, clipboard.Mode.Clipboard)
```

**Replace with:**
```python
def _copy_to_clipboard(self) -> None:
    text = self._response_text or self._text_edit.toPlainText()
    print(f"[DEBUG] Copy clicked, text length: {len(text) if text else 0}")
    if text:
        clipboard = QApplication.clipboard()
        clipboard.setText(text, QApplication.clipboard().Mode.Clipboard)
        print("[DEBUG] Clipboard write complete")
    else:
        print("[DEBUG] No text to copy")
```

### File 2: app/tray.py

**Location 1:** `_on_solve_click()` method (around line 377)

**Current instruction:**
```python
instruction = "DO NOT edit any files. DO NOT use any tools. Just analyze this problem and respond with ONLY the solution code. Output the code directly in your response, nothing else."
```

**Replace with:**
```python
instruction = """DO NOT edit any files. DO NOT use any tools. Analyze this problem and respond with ONLY the solution code.

CODE RULES:
- Use markdown code blocks with language tags
- Add brief inline comments on non-obvious lines only
- Include time/space complexity as a comment at the end (e.g., # O(n) time, O(1) space)
- Prefer readability over cleverness

Output the code directly, no preamble or explanation."""
```

**Location 2:** `_on_explain_click()` method (around line 384)

**Current instruction:**
```python
instruction = "DO NOT edit any files. DO NOT use any tools. Explain this problem clearly and teach me the concept. Output your explanation directly in your response."
```

**Replace with:**
```python
instruction = """DO NOT edit any files. DO NOT use any tools. Explain this problem clearly.

RESPONSE RULES:
- Lead with the answer, no preamble like "Great question!"
- Keep explanations to 2-3 sentences per concept
- For behavioral questions: use STAR format (Situation, Task, Action, Result) but keep it tight
- For code concepts: include a minimal example in markdown code blocks
- Sound confident, not arrogant

Output your explanation directly."""
```

### Requirements
- Maintain static typing (type hints already present, don't remove)
- No unnecessary comments in code
- Don't change method signatures
- Don't add emojis to code

Write clean, scalable, modular, efficient code. Follow single responsibility principle. Do not repeat yourself. Use consistent naming conventions. No unnecessary comments.
